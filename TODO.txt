1) The output of your program should be three values on a single line, comma separated:
    a) size of the input,
    b) number  of  comparisons  made  while  sorting  the  input
    c) execution  time  (in  nano/milliseconds).
    There should be no other output.

2) Your  program  should  take  a  single  argument  on  the command-line, which is the path to a file to read as input

3) Python  4  different [source] files with a main

4) Your  sorting  algorithms  will  be  tested  for  correctness,  so  please  ensure  they  work!
   This  includes  edge  cases like inputs with a single value, odd number of values, even number of values, etc.
